Your bank offers you to invest some of your money in a new startup company. If everything goes well, you can keep all the profit that the investment returns after 1 year.
Additionally, the bank also offers to add a smaller amount of money to the investment, which is returned completely to the bank after this 1 year (but you are allowed to keep the profit of the bank's portion, in case the investment is successful).
Since you are excited about this offer, you decide to invest quite some money into this deal.
In total 1 000 000 $ are invested; you provide the largest share of 99% and the bank the remaining 1%.

However, after one year the bank sends you a letter and informs you that the startup company went bankrupt and some of the invested money is lost. But the bank tells you not to worry too much, since you still own 98% of the remaining money. Certainly, the rest of the remaining money, which is the same amount of money that the bank invested in the beginning, will be payed back to the bank. Should you really not be worried? Think a little about this and guess how much money you actually have left after this false investment, or: how many dollars did you actually loose?

On the first glance it might not seem to be such a bad loss, since the money that the bank invested was 99% yours and after one year 98% of the remaining money is still yours. But let us think a little bit more carefully: We know that the bank invested 1% x 1 000 000 $ = 10 000 $. As agreed beforehand, the bank will get this amount of money back, even though the investment did not go well. Since you own 98% of the remaining money, the other 2% (which is the before mentioned 10 000 $) belong to the bank. So if 2% correspond to 10 000 $, then 98% correspond to 490 000 $. Or to put it in an equation: if $$x$$ is the remaining money after the investment, then we can write:

$$
\begin{align*}
x &= 10\,000 $ + 0.98x \\
0.02x &= 10\,000 $ \\
x &= \frac{10\,000 $}{0.02} = 500\,000 $ \\
0.98x &= 0.98 \cdot 500\,000 $ = 490\,000 $
\end{align*}
$$

Since you invested 99% x 1 000 000 $ = 990 000 $, you actually lost 500 000 $ (which is more than 50% of the original amount of money that you invested). So, I would not be too amused, if I was in your situation.
